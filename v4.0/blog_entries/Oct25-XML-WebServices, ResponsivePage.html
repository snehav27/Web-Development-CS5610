        <hr />

           <p>
             I have done 4 Expriments this week .
              I have worked on following Eperiments : </br>
              1) Extracting XML information from Web Service with simple proxy. <br />
              2) Resposive Navigation Bar<br />
              3) Responsive Image to convert to Text as screen turns small <br />
              4) Responsive Table content.<br />
             <br />
            <br />

               
               <b> Extracting XML information from Web Service with simple proxy:</b></br>
                          
               I have done same experiment through javascript which failed without CORS : SO I had to shift to .NET to use
               SimpleProxy class written by Prof. Richard Rasala to obtain the response .<br />  Using simple proxy will eliminate
               problem of CORS(which stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, is an HTML5 feature that allows one site to access
               another site's resources despite being under different domain names.) .<br />  In my case mentioning CORS feature in JAVA script
               didnt work.<br />
               Failed experiment in the following link : 
               <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/snehav27/experiments/ajax/Fuel%20Prices.html"> Link</a>
               <br />     <br />   
               
               I have tried using Ajax and xml extraction , this worked when CORS was enabled manually in the browser. 
                    
            </br>   
               Used the following code , but didnt work.    
               <pre>
                    xmlhttp.open('GET', url, true);             <br />              
                    xmlhttp.setRequestHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*"); <br />
                    xmlhttp.setRequestHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "X-Requested-With");<br />
                    xmlhttp.send();<br />
</pre>                              
        </p>

            <b> Resposive Navigation Bar :</b> <br />
           For future project I need a navigation bar which is required to work on both the small devices as well as large devices.
            Which will change its view mode according to the user viewing device.
        </p>
<b> Responsive Image to convert to Text as screen turns small :</b></br>

            This experiment is done to show image in larger screen devices and to show text in smaller screen devices.
            Images occupy more space in the devices becuase they are downloaded and stored in temp folder. Until unless they are deleted they will occupy space , which
            is okay in large screen devices but same will be not good when used in smaller devices which will take time to load and store lot of space.
            So this way of designing should be good for smaller screen devices and larger screen devices as per performance.

    <b> Responsive Table content :</b><br/>
    I always wondered if there is any way to make table responsive since tables are not designed to shrink like div or p (paragraph) .
    wrapping will make table not only ugly also clients or users of the site unhappy. When I was going through articles of responsive table.
    I found a very useful article which explains different type of table changes according to screen size. The method I have used was the best one
    because no data will be hided from the user.<br />

<b>Summary : </b> </br>
<p>
    This Week I have got more understanding on responsive web pages .</br>
    1)From the Jose class I have got an idea on content change , drag , update functions through JQuery . I have got an idea , will try to implement it 
        but not sure if its gonna work , thought of creating editorial page for admin where news of car information will be posted  with Image ,youtube link, 
    and the posted information will sent to the mongoDb and inserted DB in Openshift. And there will page which will show the news feed . </br> 
    Will surely try this , but not sure if thats gonna work.</br> 
    2)I was not able to connect to database ,  got information from Prof RASALA that I need to give IP address inorder to access the server. 
    I was trying to insert details in DB from db text data downloaded from <a href="fueleconomy.gov"> FUEl GOV</a> . Will be doing this next week
    and will create a page with  milage information , where user will be able to search and get  milage information  of the car.
