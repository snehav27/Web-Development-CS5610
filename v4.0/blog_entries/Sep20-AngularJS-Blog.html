           <p>
             Knowing Angular JS is the best part of this week. Professor Jose has explained it very clearly .
               I never had any idea on framwork AngularJS. It saves lot of coding from developer end. Once we know how to use AngularJS
               framwork it  will be one of the powerfull framwork to use . 
               Applications can be developed without any hard work. 
               Page  doesnot refresh when add ,edit,delete functions are used. 
               A full fledged application can be developed without .NET or JAVA.

            I did two experiments in AngularJS This week

              I have understood the concept of AngularJS and use of ng-app ,ng-controller,ng-bind,ng-model,ng-repeat.
               How to use $scope in the project.

            <b> Login Page with Validations : </b>
           I have designed login page with predefine login entries and checked if validation is working fine .
            Also checked for different input entries to check if validation is working fine.
            This will be the logic for my final project login screen.
        </p>

<b>Summary : </b> </br>
<p>
All three the experiments  done this week will be usefull for my future project.
    1)login screen
    2) When fetching data from API will be using Angular JS to load the page .
