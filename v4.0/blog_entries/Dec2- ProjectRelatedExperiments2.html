            <br />

               
               <b>  Adding Iframe . :</b></br>              
             I have used I frame provided by carbonfootprint . They have provided Iframe which included bikes, cars all the automobile types
               I have contacted them to get Iframe only for car. They have provided me with the iframe which is only for car.
               This particula Iframe gives information about the car emission of carbon dioxide , User should enter details of the car and user will
               be able to fetch details of the carbon emission.

                <br />   <br />
                                     
            <b> Create and Drag HTML Elements using JS :</b> <br />
        This experiment is done to allow only admin to use the create news info in  my final project. Where admin will have the permission to create the news.
               News that is created with the html elements will be sent to mongo DB in my final project.
               This experiment is done as reference to news page.
            </p>
<p>
    <b> Fetching From MongoDB and showind on the screen   :</b></br>

    So the news created and inserted into Mongo DB in openshift will be shown on the screen with title on it.
    This will be the article page in my final project.And onclick on the news user can see actual news content on the screen.
</p>
<p>
    <b> Go Green using Mileage. :</b><br/>
    Go green screen using mileage , I have 5 table's and all the five tables have the same content . It will be good 
    for the user to fetch details as per his input city mileage , highway mileage and combined mileage into the text box. 
    So where condition is created as per user selection and all the tables info are combined using union all .
</p>
<p>
<b> Go Green using  Score:</b><br />
    Go green screen using score , I have 5 table's and all the five tables have the same content . It will be good
    for the user to fetch details as per his input using score , user has a choice to either fetch data based on the air pollution score or
    green house score.So where condition is created as per user selection and all the tables info are combined using union all .

</p>

<p>
    <b> Marque:</b><br />
    Marque is an element in html which will scroll the text inside it . I want to scroll the data that is fetched from web service for todays
    fuel price in my gogreen page of my final project.
</p>
<p>
    <p><b>News delete Page :</b><br />
    News Delete page is for admin. Admin will have all the rights to delete the news articles. Since data is available in mongo db
    news data will be deleted by passing the id of the record through URL.
    </p>
