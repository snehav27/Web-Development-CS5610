             I was working on experiements related to project for two weeks, following are 7 experiments I have done:.
              I have worked on following Eperiments : </br>
              1) Fetching drop down values depending on previous drop down values . <br />
              2) Car Equipment details<br />
              3) Car Price Details<br />
              4) Car Ratings Details.<br />
              5) Car Images.<br />
              6) Dealer Information.<br />

               <b> Fetching drop down values depending on previous drop down values . :</b></br>              
              Since  I have data in DB , and want to show the other drop downs based on previous drop down.
               So I have used the recursive drop down. So on select index change of the first drop down second will be loaded.
               when second drop down index change , third will be loaded according to the selection done on first and second. 
                 <br />   <br />
                                     
            <b> Car Equipment details :</b> <br />
          From Edmunds API I have got details of the each equipment and was showing on the screen.
               So for every car there are equipments, to know in detail about the equipments user will be able to search and fetch the information.
               Here I have used .
               In this experiment , I am deciding which URL to be used according to the selection of the equipment.
               I have also implemented Recursive drop down here to get style ID.
            </p>
<p>
    <b> Car Price details   :</b></br>

    Price information plays a major role in selecting any car. I have used API to show car price info on the screen.
    In this experiment Also I am deciding which URL should be used according to the user selection. 
    I have also implemented Recursive drop down here to get style ID.
</p>
<p>
    <b> Car Ratings Details. :</b><br/>
    User will always need review of any other person who have used cars. In this experiement I have checked the count of reviews
    and deciding if need to show information on the screen or not.I have also implemented Recursive drop down here to get style ID.<br />
    
</p>
<p>
<b> Car Images :</b><br />
    I have already done this experiment but want to implement database with API , So I have used DB to fetch the style ID and 
    get the images of the car that needs to  be displayed.<br />

</p>

<p>
    <b> Dealer Information :</b><br />
    In this experiment I was showing dealers information  according zip code that user enters. This experiment is different from
    other experiments since I have used latitude and longitude provided by API to show position on the google map.
</p>
<p>
    <b> Sharing Content in Social Network Sites :</b><br />
    In this experiment I have shown how to share content to four different social networking sites. 
    1)facebook <br />
    2) Google + <br />
    3) Twitter <br />
    4) Linked In <br />

</p>
<b>Summary : </b> </br>
<p>
    I am getting to know lot of things when I am doing my project. I am always thinking about what will be the user perspective.<br />
    What would user like to know when they enters to the site. This thought made me to think why would user want to know only 
    about 5 car images . <br />I have hardcoded those five cars with their style ID's. This made me to get the information
    of the each car from the API and insert into DB.<br /> I have inserted approximatly 26000 records to get the style ID according to the
    user selection of the car and display information accordingly.
     
    I am looking foward to see my own project , on how it going to be . :)
