<h2>Blog for first experiment on ASP .NET  </h2>

        <hr />

           <p>
              This is my first encounter with .NET , I have always wondered how .NET coding structure would be .
              I have spent my whole day (Sep 11) stdying about .NET , to my surprise it is similar to JAVA web development . 
              Methods were written inside Scripts in C# language/VB .        
             <br />

            <b>Timer Control:</b></br>
            <br />
            I was excited to do my first experiment in .NET .  Timer control would be very useful when 
               periodical update of Live data  content  . For example : Gold price , Stock price, 
               Cricket Score. Which will also play significant part in my future project.
               </br>
              I have understood the concept of Update panel ,trigger,content-template from this experiment.

               <B>Problem faced :</B></br>
               I have faced a problem where I have found in JAVA we use .equals method to compare two strings but in C# we use .Equals -->
               E was in caps  . It took sometime to realize the difference.

            <b> Responsive Image : </b>
            Responsive Images are used to shrink and expand the image in the website as per screen size.

            I have learnt how to use @media screen in style such that images become more resposive to 
            the screen for the device which we are using.
        </p>

<b>Code Snippet : </b> </br>
<p>  @media screen and (max-width: 620px) { </br>
            #rspImage {</br>
                width: 340px;</br >
            }</br>
        }</p>

            <b>   Loading Gif :</b> 
            Loading image will show background processd is still happening and
             restrict user from right click or any other operation. From this experiment I understood differnt ways 
            of showing loading screen.Page request manager is one of the way used for the ecperiment to load the image on the screen.

                var progressBarPRM = Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManager.getInstance(); </br >

                //Raised during the initialization of the asynchronous postback. </br >

                progressBarPRM.add_initializeRequest(progressBarPRM_InitializeRequest); </br >

                //Raised after an asynchronous postback is finished </br >

                progressBarPRM.add_endRequest(progressBarPRM_EndRequest); </br >
