           <p>
             I have completed three different experiments .
              I have worked on following Eperiments : </br>
              1)HTML Experiment.     
              2)Edmund API with AngularJS
              3)CSS Experiment
             <br />
            <br />

               
               <b>HTML Experiment:</b></br>
               <br />               
                Every project needs a Date Picker and Time Picker , In this experiment I have used HTML5 date picker and time picker
               Also used done validations on date where </br>
               1)Start Date should be less than end date
               2)If dates are sane Start time should be less that End time
               <br />
              <br/>
            <b>Edmund API with Angular JS:</b></br>
            <br />
            I was searching for API which are related to cars . And this week I found a very good website which provides API for 
             car related Information. This API will be useful for my future project to show details about cars
             </br>
              From this experiment  I have easily extracted JSON data from API and displayed on the web page using Angular JS.
               It was easy because i already used ebay API.
               Took time to understand Edmund API - It was pretty good . I am really happy I found this API , 
               I want to propose this API for my future project , will be contacting professor Jose to discuss on this.
            <br />
            This took time but it was easy.
