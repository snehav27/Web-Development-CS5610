<h2>Blog ... When Rest API created (JSON,NodeJS,MongoDb,OpenShift)</h2>

        <hr />

           <p>
             I have done 4 Expriments this week on NodeJS .
              I have worked on following Eperiments : </br>
              1)Simple NodeJS responce    <br />
              2)Static JSON responce<br />
              3)Hosted Static AngularJS content in Open Shift<br />
              4)Getting CARReview  in JSON fromat from MongoDB.<br />
             <br />
            <br />

               
               <b>Simple NodeJS Experiment:</b></br>
               <br />               
                This experiment is done to fetch simple responce from NodeJS
               <br />           
            <b>Static JSON responce Experiment:</b></br>
            <br />
            In this experiment I am returning static information in JSON format.
               res.json in nodejs will send any information  responce in  JSON format to client.
             </br>                                     
        </p>

        <p>
            <b> Hosting AngularJS Page in OpenShift :</b> <br />
           I did this eperiment to get the gist on how to host Angular information in OpenShift.
            So I can use both DB and Angular JS to create a dynamic web page.
        </p>

<p>
    <b> Getting CarReview in JSON format from MongoDB :</b><br/>
    This was the more time taking experiment , Since we are connecting to MongoDB Database.
    I got same errors as Professor Jose got it ,Since class was recorded in youtube I was able debug my 
    issue easily.
</p>
<b>Summary : </b> </br>
<p>
In this Experiments CarReview in JSON format from MongoDB  will be used in my future project.
Where I will be fetching data from MongoDB in Openshift by receiving information in JSON fromat and 
will be showing reviews of the car on my website.</br>
I wil be creating my own rest API to show review of the cars iny final project.</br>
So in this case: </br>
--> Application created in Openshift will send me information in JSON format acting as server.</br>
--> Application created in College will be acting as a client receive information from th Application I have created in Open shift.
