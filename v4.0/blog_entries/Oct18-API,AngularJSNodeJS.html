           <p>
             I have done 4 Expriments this week .
              I have worked on following Eperiments : </br>
              1) NodeJS delete and create entry into MongoDB using URL query string <br />
              2) NodeJS update entry in MongoDB using URL query string<br />
              3) Getting car images from Edmunds API <br />
              4) Angular Slidshow on images in the directive after particular timeout<br />
             <br />
            <br />

               
               <b>NodeJS Create and Delete Entry in MongoDB Experiment:</b></br>
                          
                This experiment is done to create  entry and delete entry in mongodb hosted by open shift using url string.
                This will make user to delete data and get information from the db data which is hosted and get the information .
               <br />     <br />        
            <b>NodeJS update entry in MongoDB using URL query string Experiment:</b></br>
          
            This experiment is done to update entry which is already available in DB which is hosted by openshift.
            When user updates in the front end , in back end  url string will be hitting the database and  updates the data..
             </br>                                     
        </p>

        <p>
            <b> Getting car images from Edmunds API :</b> <br />
           Through this experiment I was getting more familiarize Edmunds API.
             So that I will be more comfortable in my future project. In this experiment I am fetching the CAR images from Edmund API
            according to user selection.</br> I also came to know every car is assigned to style ID through which images data are connected and also we can
            combine String url and get the data from Edmund.
        </p>

<p>
    <b> Angular Slidshow on images in the directive after particular timeout :</b><br/>
    I want to show slide show of the images after every 5 - 6 seconds. Which can be used in my future project page.<br />
    Understood the usage of the directive in Angular JS and ng-show:<br />
    Code: <br />
    1) sliderApp.directive('slider', function ($timeout) {<br />
    2) ng-show : $first ,ng-show : invisible<br />
    ng-show will modify  the view accordingly to the mentioned .<br />
    For Example:<br />
    $first will return first element in array and will ignore other elements<br />
    invisble  will make element to be invisible until visible is set to bg-show.<br />
</p>
<b>Summary : </b> </br>

    This Week I have got more familerized with Edmunds API .</br>
    1)Also I have read Sites on FUEL ECONOMY details of the cars , to show details fuel consumption for each car. Which can be inserted into DB as static data and
    shown on screen as per user selection. This information is given by US. govt</br>
