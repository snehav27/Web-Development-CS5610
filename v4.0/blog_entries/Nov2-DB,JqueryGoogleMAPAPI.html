           <p>
             I have done 4 Expriments this week .
              I have worked on following Eperiments : </br>
              1) Fetching drop down values from DB . <br />
              2) Displaying table from after specific user selection<br />
              3) Tab contents <br />
              4) Google Map API - to get near by parking information for car.<br />
             <br />
            <br />

               
               <b> Fetching drop down values from DB . :</b></br>
               I have done a simple experiment to fetch drop down values from Database. So when page load happens 
               aspx code will call database and fetch the data from DB.
                 <br />   <br />
                                     
            <b> Displaying table from after specific user selection :</b> <br />
           Every Site will have some static information of previous years or coming years where real and predicted values are calculated.
               This week I have inserted tables related Polution related information into database from FUEL Gov .US </br> 
               I have inserted 2011.2012,2013,2014,2015 related car polution information.</br> 
               In this experiment I have tried to get the information from one of the inserted table on selection of the drop down .
               So when user selects particular selection , user will be able to see all the information related to the selection criteria.
        </p>
<b> Tab contents  :</b></br>

  In this experiment I have used Jquery to switch between each tab which is defined in the HTML . <br />Tab are user friendly and can be used to navigate 
from one section to another.From this experiment , I have learned Jquery usage , we can change the content on the html dynamically.

    <b> Google MAP API :</b><br/>
    Google Maps API is a collection of APIs that enable you to overlay your own data on a customized Google Map. With the help of google MAP API,
    I am fetching nearby car parking locations to display on the screen. I have failed to fetch near by car service due to less Auto service near by.
    <br />
