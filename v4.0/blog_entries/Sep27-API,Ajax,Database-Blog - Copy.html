           <p>
            This I have took three different experiments and faced many challenges .
              I have worked on following Eperiments : </br>
              1)Database Experiment.     
              2)Ebay API with AngularJS
              3)Ajax Experiment
             <br />
            <br />

               
               <b>Database:</b></br>
               <br />               
               I have understood how to connect to database using the asp.net and and showing table data using asp:gridview
               Also i have created a static table with coloumns->  auto incrimental column , coloumn having null value and coloumn having 
               non null values.
               <br />
               <b>Problem faced :</b></br>
               I had a problem connecting to the database from home , then I have came to know that tunneling should be done inorder access database
               from outside CCS network.

            <b>Ebay API with Angular JS:</b></br>
            <br />
            I have faced more difficulties in doing this experiment.
               </br>
              From this experiment  I have learned to extract JSON data from API and displaying on the web page using Angular JS.
            <br />
               <B>Problem faced :</B></br>
                When  I was doing this Experiment I have faced problem with CORS enable , Still working on this issue : </br>               
               XMLHttpRequest cannot load </br>
                http://svcs.ebay.com/services/search/FindingService/v1?SECURITY-APPNAME=Nor…A-FORMAT=JSON&REST-PAYLOAD&keywords=sneha&paginationInput.entriesPerPage=1. </br>
               No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.</br>
                Origin 'http://net4.ccs.neu.edu' is therefore not allowed access. </br>
               <b>Tempoaray Resolution for this problem:</b>
               Add CORS plugin avaialable in Google , Then ouput can be fetched without any problem.
        </p>

            <b> Simple Ajax Program: </b>
           I have created simple ajax program to explore how syntax works.
        </p>

<b>Summary : </b> </br>
<p>
Experiment done on EBAY API will be taken as template and will be connecting UBER API to fetch data.
