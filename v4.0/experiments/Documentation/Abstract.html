                <b>CS5610: Web Development </b>is one of the most practice oriented courses that I have taken in my masters program. Learning by experimenting has been a great experience, under the guidance of eminent faculty.

                Foremost, I would like to express my deepest thanks to my two supervisors Dr Annunziato, Jose and Dr Prof Richard Rasala . Their encouragement, and immense knowledge were key motivations
                throughout my course. Professor Jose  allowed us to learn new technologies like node.js,mongodb,angular js for which I am greatful.
                I would like to thank my TA Sandeep  for oﬀering thorough and excellent feedback on an earlier experiments of this course and thanks for making sure that I was following in the correct path.
                 In addition, a thank you to TA Venkatesh who gave feedback and tips everytime I have approached.
            </p>
